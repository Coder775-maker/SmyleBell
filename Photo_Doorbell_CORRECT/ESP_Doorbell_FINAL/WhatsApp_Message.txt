Hey everyone, I'm Anurag, I live in number 18 and I want to let you know about a product that I've been making over the summer: The SmyleBell.
The SmyleBell is essentially a smart doorbell which is capable of capturing photos of your front door at the click of a button whilst also providing phone notifications.
The entire motivation behind this product was to improve neighbourhood security. A while back a few burglaries happened which was very concerning so I decided that one way
to improve neighbourhood security was to create an AFFORDABLE smart doorbell

Copmared to other competitors, the SmyleBell costs 1/10th of the cost at Â£10 making it affordable to everyone. What's more is that the profit made is not going towards self gain but rather to charity making the SmyleBell a charitable cause.]
The money can be donated to any charity of your choice and if you would like to donate more to charity that is amazing.

If you would like further details or you would like to get in touch please email at this address: smylebell@gmail.com

Please also see the e-version of our leaflet for more information.

Have a great day everyone!!
Hope to get into contact with some of you soon!
