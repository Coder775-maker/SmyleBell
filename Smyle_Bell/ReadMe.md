Welcome to the SmyleBell repository. This repo contains all the material and code I used and created to make the SmyleBell as a neighborhood security project.
The repo is split into 2 folders:

Extra Material - contains the instruction manual for use if purchasing one as well as the breadboard circuit diagram used to make it.

Smyle_Bell_Final - contains the actual source code and all files needed to be uploaded onto your ESP-32 CAM module for use.
